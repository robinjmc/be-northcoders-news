# NCN backend checklist
- [done] add a basic static html page on the main / or /api route that lists all the possible endpoints (dont need to test this just for the deployed production mode for viewer)
- [X] README clear and instructions accurate
  - need to write: i realise i said i'd sent you notes for this so i'll send them now
        - what the project is: a restful api serving up data organised into articles comments etc
        - how its build using node, npm mongo
        - link to deployed version
        - setup guide for user inc. checking technology prerequisites i.e. node, mongo...
        - explain how to set up config and seed db and run tests and server so they can have it running locally: but crucially not the production config one as a) it has your password in and b) you dont want some randomer to be able to reseed your production database
        - break down all endpoints available and what they give

- [X]  Needs instructions to seed database
- [O] [done] Package.json includes dependencies (mocha in particular) organised into dev and not dev
  - dont need to set production in start script heroku should do that for you but i'll ask around if this is a best practice thing anyway bc could easily make an argument for keeping it in anyway
- [O] Seed function relies on data and DBURL passed to it not global variables
  - perfecto
  - also your keeping things immutable yas queen
  - not sure i understand you're qu at bottom of devseed file so we'll talk about this
- [X] No errors in the console [done ?] 

app.js
   - [done] small thing but your console.log once you've connected just says dev DBURL do you want it to be dev or the full dbURL?
   - take out console.logs
  - error handling: you should't be in a situation where you're getting type errors passed to error handling try dealing with that in your controllers.

listen.js
  - take out top console.log [robin: am I just supposed to call app.listen ?]

routers
  - nice addition of the index.js
- [X] Routes broken down with `Router.route` [robin: I have done this right?]
 - neaten up with router.route e.g. [done]

 ```js
 router.route('/:article_id/comments')
  .get(getComments)
  .post(postComment)
 ```

controllers
 
 - [done] dude overboard with the module exports wrap around: a better way to do this would be to do this which will make it much more readable [robin: what would I put at the bottom with module]
 ```js
 exports.functionName = (req,res,next) => {

 }

 exports.anotherFunction = (req,res,next) => {

 }
 ```
  - try refactoring the way you've done the comment count theres a lot of unnessecary loops involved in this!
  - also keep up immutability best practices that you used in your seed function
  - delete commented out code
  - woahh you're post comment/article is more complex than it needs to be you create a new user everytime and while this is neat functionality it might actually seem like a glitch on the front end when you get round to it: id advise keeping it as a stable new user or going and finding an existing user in your database ( i think i set up a stooge user called northcoder and always used them for posts)
  - really nice checking your resStatuses in your puts
  - **tailor your error handling a little more make sure that things are explicit in your catch blocks: hopefully should remove need for the typeerror checker in your middlewear**

## implements all endpoints
- [X] [done] `GET /api/topics/:topic_id/articles`
  - make sure to add comment count to these too

## Testing 
  general: - the after() testing hook should still go at the top of the document with your beforeEach 
          - presuming the timeout is bc your laptop is slow?
          - lots of console logs left in!
- [O] Tests against `usefulData` 
  - sometimes useful data sometimes you hardcode things: should always use the articleDocs returned where possible
  - also when posting if you save test articles/comments into a variable then you can refer to that in your expect statement rather than hardcoding the result again
  - check some things like posts more explicitly: if you post a comment to an article need to make sure the comments belongs_to is the same as the id of the article...
  - your delete test is a little silly: you're reseeding anyway so don't worry about creating a comment to delete: what might be useful if you want to is to delete then do a request for that one and it should give you a 404
  - your comments are nice but they stop halfway through: be consistent if you want to leave in comments for other developers
  - put ignores increment query is wrongly tested (it's not ignoring it!)
